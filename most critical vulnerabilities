7. Document the most critical vulnerabilities

1)Since only one vulnerability was found, hereâ€™s a structured summary of it:

2)Vulnerability: Weak SSL/TLS cipher (TLS_RSA_WITH_SEED_CBC_SHA).

3)Severity: Medium (CVSS 5.9).

4)Impact: Attackers could intercept or decrypt sensitive data.

5)Affected Port: 5432/tcp (PostgreSQL SSL service).

6)Exploitation: Man-in-the-middle attack possible with weak cipher downgrade.

7)CVE References: CVE-2013-2566, CVE-2015-2808, CVE-2015-4000.

8)Solution Type: Mitigation through configuration changes.

9)Fix: Disable weak cipher suites in PostgreSQL and enforce TLS 1.2/1.3.

10)Verification: Rescan the host after configuration changes to confirm fix.

Residual Risk: If weak ciphers are not removed, communication remains vulnerable to cryptographic attacks.
