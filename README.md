This project aims to identify common vulnerabilities present on a local computer system using OpenVAS Community Edition, a free and open-source vulnerability scanner. The objective was to assess the security posture of the localhost (127.0.0.1) by conducting a full vulnerability scan. OpenVAS was installed and configured to perform scans, and its vulnerability feeds (including NVTs, SCAP, and CERT data) were synced to ensure up-to-date detection capabilities. A target was created for the local system, and a scan was run using the "Full and fast" configuration. The resulting report highlighted any discovered vulnerabilities, categorized by severity, along with relevant CVE identifiers and recommended remediation steps. The final output is a detailed vulnerability scan report, presented in PDF format or through screenshots, which provides insight into potential security risks on the system. This process demonstrates the practical use of OpenVAS for local vulnerability assessment and emphasizes the importance of regular security scanning.
